# Hi, I'm Mahi 👋

I’m fascinated by how **complex systems emerge from simple ideas**.  
In my free time, I build things from scratch — from **low-level CUDA kernel experiments** and **neural network implementations** to **backend architectures** and **reinforcement learning agents**.

I’m currently working as a **Machine Learning Engineer @ Nasir Syntax Solution Limited**,  
where I focus on building scalable ML systems and production-grade backend ML services.

Currently exploring:  
- **MLOps & Machine Learning Engineering**  
- **Backend Engineering**  
- **GPU Programming & CUDA Kernels**
